If not\nset, the default cluster-wide tolerance is applied (by default 10%).\n\nFor example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of 100Mi,\nand scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively, scaling will be\ntriggered when the actual consumption falls below 95Mi or exceeds 101Mi.\n\nThis is an alpha field and requires enabling the HPAConfigurableTolerance\nfeature gate.\n\n+featureGate=HPAConfigurableTolerance\n+optional"
