Welcome to the Portainer CE API documentation site.

This site provides reference documentation for the Portainer Community Edition API.
Use it to explore available endpoints, request and response schemas, and version-specific API behavior.

## Versioned documentation

Documentation is organized into global sections (tabs), with one tab for each supported Portainer version.
Select a version tab to view the API reference that matches your Portainer CE deployment.
